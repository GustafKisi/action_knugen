# Action Sam Jackson
 

 ## Purpose

 This Github Action was made mainly to serve the repo for Samuel Log Jackson, though you can use it for your repo, if you are a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson

 ## Usage

 You can add the action to your Action YAML file like so: 
 ```
  - uses: lob/action_sam_jackson@0.0.2
    with:
        message: '<your message />'
        token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```

Both the `message` and the  `token` parameters are required.
